1. the new sending and recving mechanism works as follows:

server_v3 has 3 sockets:
socket_listen to send the data to all the client terminal units
socket_listen2 to send the data to all the client terminal units
recver is to recv data from the client terminal units

sending data has two threads as follows:
1. to send the data to the client terminal units.
2. to send the data to the client display unit.
3. to recv the data we are using the same thread as that of game loop

this way we are ensuring that data reaches to all the clients at the appropriate time...

format of ack message will be 1 and -1; exculding the use of 0, because it can be sometimes misleading
1: message received properly
-1: did not receive the message so resend it/
