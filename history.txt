so, 
the update for 3rd july 2023 is: 
the game is working okay in UDP, We are using UDP alone, and no extra toppings over it.
the problem seems to be in showing the timeline in the client display unit, the problem maybe in sending data one by one,
this has to changed.
more over we need to check if the game is responsive to the slightest commands of the algorithm. I know this may be difficult, but we need to make
it most responsive in any scenario.
now since the game is running on UDP, we need to make another logic for lobby_server now since socket transferring is obsolete now.
But instead of sending the socket and recreating it, we can just send the client ip address and port to the game server.

make the game production ready, add the database, prepare the leaderboard, we launch now.

11th july 2023:

so working on lobby server, refining it as much as i can.
added the variable port thing for game servers
add the select functionality to make the server robust. so tha it doesn't lag anywhere.
make the lobby listen workable, and then we are done with the server.
